# Elm Seedling

This is just a basic skeleton I find myself using whenever starting a new Elm project. Feel free to clone, fork, copy/paste, whatever!

## What's inside?

`src/Main.elm` is where you start building your Elm code.

`public/css/main.css` is where you start building your CSS code.

`public/index.html` is where you start mucking with Javascript.

## To run locally using `elm-live`

```
./bin/run.sh
```

## To deploy to S3

```
./bin/deploy.sh
```
